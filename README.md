A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This Flutter application demonstrates an animated list where users can add and remove items with smooth transitions. The app includes:


**Animated List:** Displays a list of animal names with smooth animations for adding and removing items.

**FAB Navigation:** A Floating Action Button (FAB) allows users to navigate to a new page for adding a new animal.

**Add Animal Page:** Users can input an animal name and return to the main list with a slide and fade transition.

**Duplicate Check:** Ensures that duplicate animal names are not added, with feedback provided via a Snackbar.

**Features**

**Add Item:** Click the FAB to navigate to a new page, input a name, and return to the list with an animation.

**Remove Item:** Swipe or click the delete icon to remove items from the list with smooth animations.

**Case-Insensitive Check:** Prevents adding duplicate names regardless of case.

**Usage**

1. Run the app.

2. Click the FAB to navigate to the "Add Animal" page.

3. Enter a new animal name and press "Add".

4. The new name will appear in the list with a smooth transition if itâ€™s not a duplicate.

5. Remove items by clicking the delete icon.
